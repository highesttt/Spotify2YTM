# 🎵 Spotify2YTM - Spotify to YouTube Music Playlist Converter 🎵

A Python-based tool to migrate your Spotify playlists to YouTube Music automatically

## 📝 Backstory

Following Spotify's recent crackdown on android mods, I switched to Youtube Music. However, every tool I found was either paid or didn't work. So, I decided to make my own.
However, there's a little twist, this is the only code available on my GitHub that is 100% generated by AI (Claude 3.7 Thinking on VSCode via GH Copilot). I have a strong hatred for generative AI and people ONLY using generative AI to create code and take credit for it. I usually write my code from scratch, but this was an experiment to see how far AI can go in coding. I did not write a single line of code in this repo. Don't expect future projects to be like this. I am not a fan of AI-generated code, nor am I proud of this. I am only keeping this here as an experiment and see how far it can go without me interfering.
